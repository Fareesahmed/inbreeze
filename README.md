## Getting Started

### Nix OS

To quickly run the project locally on Nix OS, use the `nix develop` command. This sets up a Nix shell with all dependencies fetched, ready for development. To run the application on Linux, execute `flutter run -d linux`.

For targeting other devices:
1. Run `flutter devices` to list available devices.
2. Target your chosen device with the appropriate command.

The Nix development environment is configured to run successfully on Linux, Chrome, and Android.
